  1. TCP and SMTP
  2. Short for Simple Mail Transfer Protocol, a protocol for sending e-mail messages between servers. Most e-mail systems that send mail over the Internet use SMTP to send messages from one server to another; the messages can then be retrieved with an e-mail client using either POP or IMAP.
  SMTP is part of the application layer of the TCP/IP protocol. 

  It works by using a process called "store and forward," SMTP moves your email on and across networks. It works closely with something called the Mail Transfer Agent (MTA) to send your communication to the right computer and email inbox.
  SMTP is independent of the particular transmission subsystem and requires only a reliable ordered data stream channel. In addition, the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority has allocated port 25 for both TCP and UDP for use by SMTP.
