  TCP (Layer 4 of OSI Model) ensures that the data streaming from point A to point B is successfully sent and recieved.  The data comes in forms of "packets" organized according to the TCP protocol.  TCP ensures that the data maintains its integrity within these packets so that they can communicate with designated applications it influences. It ensures reliability on the structure of the data transmitted and to do so, it sacrifices speed. This is why streaming videos probably should use a different protocol other than TCP. 

  TCP uses a method called "positive acknowledgement with retransmission", which is a way to describe the process of request response that TCP utilizes.  This way, the requester knows in what order to send packets to maintain a good data stream.  The data sent will match the data recieved in byte format and will be unaltered from point A to point B. 

  While TCP structures the data being sent in raw form, HTTP (Layer 7 of OSI Model) will follow certain instructions of its own on how to read and process the data being sent via TCP.  The two most common HTTP requests are: GET and POST, where Get is requesting something back from the server, and where Post is requesting to push a change to the server. We can see the use of HTTP and TCP in mystery 1. Here, we can see HTTP wrapping the TCP data according to HTTP's parameters.
